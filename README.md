* This project is structured as follows: 

    * Models: Contains the model classes Portfolio and Stock
    * Spec: Contains the tests for the model classes

* In order to execute the test, you must use:

    * Install rspec gem via gem install
    * Go to the spec directory
    * Execute in terminal the command "bundle exec rspec ."

This project was developed using a basic Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, developing the unit tests first and then adding the functionality in the corresponding class, allowing the tests to correctly reflect and document the code functionality.
