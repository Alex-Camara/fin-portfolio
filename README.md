# Fintual-portfolio

* This project is structured as follows: 

    * Models: Contains the model classes Portfolio and Stock
    * Spec: Contains the tests for the model classes

* In order to execute the test, you must use:

    * Install rspec gem via gem install
    * Go to the spec directory
    * Execute in terminal the command "bundle exec rspec ."

This project was developed using a very basic *Test Driven Development* (TDD) approach, developing the unit tests first and then adding the functionality in the corresponding class, allowing the tests to correctly reflect and document the code functionality.
